In 6 months:

What do i hope to have knowledge about then? 
I honestly dont know what to expect in 6 months. 
But what i do hope to have is the same level of excitement and eager to learn.
Hopefully im more confident and calm about what i have been doing up until then. 
Easier to use git and github as right now, im pretty confident in github desktop, not very in vs and not at all in git bash.

What am i struggling with now?
Easy answer, the flow in how and when to use pull, fetch and those commands without a hiccup on the way that i feel overwhelming about.
I know what they should do, just not easy outside github desktop.

What do i want to remember?
- I want to remember the moment(s) both when i knew i had been accepted to the IT course in which i now am in and some of the people i told it to.
